Hello, my name is Valerie Haupt and this repo contains my answers for the software development internship assessment.

Part One:
I've put my work for the first section of the assessment in assessment-part-one.html, which includes the standard html given and the dcCMS mock up with commented points for each of the required additions

Part Two:
I chose to work on Question B of the second part of the assessment and wrote my code in NodeJS. I put operational instructions in the commented section of that file, but will repeat them here as well:

TO USE: type 'node script.js' in the command line followed by a space and one of the Nobel Prize categories to access the winner of that category and their motivation for the award from a randomly selected year between last year and 1901. For example: node script.js Chemistry
The acceptable categories are: Literature, Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Peace, and Econmics

Thank you for your consideration.
